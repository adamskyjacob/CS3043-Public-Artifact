            For our public artifact, we chose a flip-card-style website because we felt it was a simple to use, straightforward way to get the information across, while still giving some amount of complexity in terms of project development. As our project focused on analyzing, the good and bad of generative AI, as well as the algorithmic bias behind them, having flip-cards was a good way to introduce why a certain area of generative AI was good and bad, as well as the algorithmic bias behind the negatives. The format of the project wasn't inspired by any other public artifact, but the idea of comparing both the good and bad of generative AI was present in <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/generative-good-bad-future-jak-technologies-ltd/" target="_blank">this</a> article, as well as many other articles discussing the topic of generative AI.

            Drawing together the ideas behind our individual paper topics was fairly easy as we were a group of two, and how closely related our topics were. As the algorithmic bias behind generative AI closely ties into the negatives discussed, we were easily able to relate these two on the negative side of the flip-cards. As for the common problem, our encompassing topic of the social implications of generative AI has several problems that we discussed, all of which are impacted by some amount of algorithmic bias. To some extext, is does also compare and contrast responses to a computing development in different contexts as we discuss several different outlets for it's use, including how it can be used to help disabled persons and how it can improve workflow efficiency.

            As I (Jacob) had the original idea for the public artifact, he was in charge of the creation of the website, but consulted with Aanan during its creation to make sure he agreed with the design choices. As for the information on the flip-cards, we were both responsible for the blurbs regarding our topics. Regarding collaboration, I already mentioned how the creation of the website worked, as well as how he condensed our topics to a few flip-cards worth of important information.
